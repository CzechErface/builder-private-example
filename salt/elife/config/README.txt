- `etc-certificates-*` files are related to the usage of HTTPS. A wildcard certificate for `*.yourhost.org` or a certificate with Subject Alternative Names should be places here that can be used by all projects (each with its own subdomain). 
- `project-builder-pem` is an SSH private key that must be registered on Github. It will be used for checking out public projects through SSH but also any private project you may want to build. All the Continuum projects are public.
